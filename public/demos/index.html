            Below you will find descriptions and links to the interactive demos used for the presentation.

                    <p>
                    The user logger demo is the simplest of the three demos. The backend WebSocket
                    server PHP code is fairly stock and the frontend JavaScript adds a very small
                    amount of application logic on top of the core HTML5 WebSockets API. The application
                    itself demonstrates real-time monitoring of user interaction with a website by
                    recording their browser settings and broadcasting them out to all other connected
                    users.

                    <p>
                    The mouse tracking demo takes things a step further. The WebSocket server backend
                    used is exactly the same as that used in the User Logger demo. The true difference
                    is in the amount of client-side JavaScript. In this demo, we bind mouse movement
                    and click events to a callback function which records the current position. Each
                    user receives a custom generated circular dot with their own color and size. On
                    each movement, a WebSocket send event is triggered sending the server the user's
                    new coordinates. The server broadcasts the new coordinates and accompanying user
                    data to the remainder of the connected clients and they update their screens
                    accordingly.

<p>
The todo list demo takes a basic CRUD implementation of a todo list and turns it
on it's head. This demo introduces the ability to add WebSockets to an existing
PHP application. This does come at quite a cost, however, as it entails adding
a messaging layer to your existing application so it may talk to the WebSocket
server. In our case, we use ZeroMQ as it is supported by <a href="https://github.com/reactphp/zmq">react/zeromq</a>.
The application also introduces the <a href="http://wamp.ws">WAMP</a> sub-protocol of WebSockets,
allowing us to use RPC and PubSub patterns to manage the sheer number of different
event types. One of the key takeaways from this demo is the amount of edge-cases
that need to be handled due to concurrency. This includes various forms of locking
to ensure users don't step on each other's toes.
